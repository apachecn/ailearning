Hi Peter,
 
The hotels are the ones that rent out the tent. They are all lined up on the hotel grounds : )) So much for being one with nature, more like being one with a couple dozen tour groups and nature.
I have about 100M of pictures from that trip. I can go through them and get you jpgs of my favorite scenic pictures.
 
Where are you and Jocelyn now? New York? Will you come to Tokyo for Chinese New Year? Perhaps to see the two of you then. I will go to Thailand for winter holiday to see my mom : )
 
Take care,
D
