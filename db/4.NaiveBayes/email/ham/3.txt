WHat is going on there?
I talked to John on email.  We talked about some computer stuff that's it.

I went bike riding in the rain, it was not that cold.

We went to the museum in SF yesterday it was $3 to get in and they had
free food.  At the same time was a SF Giants game, when we got done we
had to take the train with all the Giants fans, they are 1/2 drunk.
